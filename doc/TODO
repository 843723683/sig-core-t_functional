- At the moment the tests are not distro / arch specific, we might need a way
  to clearly mark a test as -only-for-c4- or -only-for-c5- etc ( specially
  when there are kickstart files involved, there are some non trivial changes
  in that area moving towards c6 )

- We also need a way to dictate if a role_<test> should be run on realiron,
  virtual machine host, virtual machine ( and maybe even the type of virt
  being used! )
